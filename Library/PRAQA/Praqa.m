% Praqa is an algorithm for quantifying protein relative abundance from
% 3D fluorescent acquisitions. The algorithm reproduces the experimental
% results from the article:
%
% PRAQA: Protein Relative Abundance Quantification Algorithm for 3D 
%        Fluorescent Images (Ameli et al)
%  
%
% INPUT:
% - I : The 3D image in double format
% - ThresholdFactor : Threshold for detecting positive signal (see Theta 
%                     in the manuscript).
% - CleanProc : Enables or disables cleaning of isolated positive signal 
%               pixels.
% - GPU: Uses GPU for processing image.
% - SE (optional) : to change the SEs, edit SE.mat file and add the 
%                   desired SEs.
%
%
% OUTPUT:
% - Volume : Sum of the positive pixels throughout the whole 3D image.
% - I_final : Binarized image of I.
%

% All Rights Reserved
%
%
% REQUIRES IMAGE PROCESSING TOOLBOX and PARALLEL COMPUTING TOOLBOX
% ONLY IF CLEANPROC = TRUE or GPU = TRUE
